🏥 Medical Records Management System

A modular, SQLite-backed medical records management system built in Python with a Tkinter GUI.

This application demonstrates database design, relational modeling, backend architecture, and GUI integration in a healthcare-focused data environment.

📌 Project Summary

This project implements a structured medical database capable of managing:
	•	Patient records
	•	Diagnoses
	•	Treatments
	•	Medical tests
	•	Patient visits

The system uses a fully relational SQLite database and a modular Python backend to separate business logic from user interface components.

The GUI layer provides a clean interaction interface while preserving database integrity and backend structure.

🧠 Technical Highlights
	•	Designed a normalized relational schema with multiple linked tables
	•	Implemented one-to-many and many-to-one relationships
	•	Built modular database access layers
	•	Ensured automatic table creation and database initialization
	•	Separated backend logic from GUI logic (clean architecture principle)
	•	Implemented persistent local storage using SQLite
	•	Structured the application for scalability and future analytics integration

🛠 Tech Stack
	•	Language: Python
	•	Database: SQLite
	•	GUI Framework: Tkinter
	•	Architecture: Modular backend + UI separation

No external database server required.

🗄 Database Design

The system includes relational tables such as:
	•	patient
	•	diagnosis
	•	treatment
	•	tests
	•	patientvisit

Key design features:
	•	A diagnosis can map to multiple treatments and tests
	•	A patient can have multiple visits
	•	Visits may include tests even without a diagnosis
	•	Foreign key relationships enforce data consistency

The database file (medicalDatabase.db) is automatically generated on first execution.
